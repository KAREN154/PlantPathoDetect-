1.Business Understanding
1.1Business Overview

   Agriculture is crucial for food security and economic stability, yet essential crops like maize, potatoes, and tomatoes face rising threats from diseases that significantly reduce yields and impact farmers' livelihoods. In regions reliant on these crops, such challenges lead to economic strain, increased pesticide use, and food shortages, affecting entire communities. This project aims to address these issues by developing a machine learning-powered image classification system for early disease detection. By enabling farmers to upload crop images to a web-based platform for real-time analysis and treatment recommendations, the solution empowers them with vital insights, helping to protect yields and sustain food production.

1.2Problem Statement

   Crop diseases significantly reduce yields and incomes for farmers, impacting food security and economic stability, especially in regions with limited resources. In Kenya, farmers often lack access to timely and accurate disease detection, relying on traditional methods that delay intervention and increase losses. This project addresses the need for a more efficient, accessible solution by developing a machine learning-based system for early disease detection in maize, potatoes, and tomatoes, providing farmers with quick, actionable insights to improve crop health and productivity.

1.3Proposed Solutions

   1. Machine Learning-Based Image Classification: Developing a machine learning model, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), to classify images of maize, potatoes, and tomatoes for early disease detection. This model will be trained to recognize various crop diseases accurately.
   
   2. Web-Based Platform: Creating a user-friendly web application where farmers can upload images of their crops for real-time analysis. The platform will offer diagnosis results and treatment recommendations, making disease management accessible to farmers with limited resources.
   
   3. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Building a robust, diverse dataset of crop images to enhance model accuracy and ensure it can detect diseases across different crop species and environmental conditions.
   
   4. Agile Development and Feedback Loop: Employing an iterative, agile development approach to continuously refine the model and application based on user feedback and evolving needs.
   
   5. Integration with Local Agriculture Practices: Tailoring the solution to the specific agricultural challenges in Kenya, ensuring that the system aligns with local crop health practices and disease management strategies.
   
   6. Educational Resources and Support: Providing guidance on disease prevention and sustainable farming practices through the web application to further support farmers in maintaining crop health.
