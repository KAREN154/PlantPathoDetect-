In regions reliant on these crops, such challenges lead to economic strain, increased pesticide use, and food shortages, affecting entire communities. This project aims to address these issues by developing a machine learning-powered image classification system for early disease detection. By enabling farmers to upload crop images to a web-based platform for real-time analysis and treatment recommendations, the solution empowers them with vital insights, helping to protect yields and sustain food production."
